### Available releases

The **Linux** build requires appropriate version of **Qt to be installed**.

The **Windows** build with *vs13* suffix(built with Visual Studio 2013) has no external dependencies.

The **Windows** build with *vs19* suffix (built with Visual Studio 2019) requires the [redistributable package for Visual Studio 2015 - 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

The **Windows** build with *vs10* suffix is built with Qt4 (legacy) - in contrast to the other builds that are with Qt5 (recommended). It is prepared for the purpose of backward compatibility with old versions of Windows (i.e. XP), and may be lacking some of the features.
